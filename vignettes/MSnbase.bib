The goals of the project include: fostering collaborative development and widespread use of innovative software, reducing barriers to entry into interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting the achievement of remote reproducibility of research results. We describe details of our aims and methods, identify current challenges, compare Bioconductor to other open bioinformatics projects, and provide working examples.},

@Article{Taylor2007,
        Abstract = {Both the generation and the analysis of proteomics data are now widespread, and high-throughput approaches are commonplace. Protocols continue to increase in complexity as methods and technologies evolve and diversify. To encourage the standardized collection, integration, storage and dissemination of proteomics data, the Human Proteome Organization’s Proteomics Standards Initiative develops guidance modules for reporting the use of techniques such as gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. This paper describes the processes and principles underpinning the development of these modules; discusses the ramifications for various interest groups such as experimentalists, funders, publishers and the private sector; addresses the issue of overlap with other reporting guidelines; and highlights the criticality of appropriate tools and resources in enabling ’MIAPE-compliant’ reporting.},

@Article{Ross2004,
        Abstract = {We describe here a multiplexed protein quantitation strategy that provides relative and absolute measurements of proteins in complex mixtures. At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5’ to 3’ decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.},

Software implementations have been developed to enable conversion from most popular proprietary and open-source formats, and mzIdentML will soon be supported by the major public repositories. These developments enable proteomics scientists to start working with the standard for exchanging and publishing data sets in support of publications and they provide a stable platform for bioinformatics groups and commercial software vendors to work with a single file format for identification data.},
