@Article{Ross2004,
	Abstract = {We describe here a multiplexed protein
		  quantitation strategy that provides relative and
		  absolute measurements of proteins in complex
		  mixtures. At the core of this methodology is a
		  multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield
		  amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides
		  are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense
		  low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support
		  quantitation. In this study, we have examined the
		  global protein expression of a wild-type yeast
		  strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta
		  mutant strains that are defective in the
		  nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5’ to
		  3’ decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate
		  the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative
		  protein measurements simultaneously with
		  determination of absolute levels of a target protein
		  using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find
		  that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common
		  as well as unique effects on protein expression.},
