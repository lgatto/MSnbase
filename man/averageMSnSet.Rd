\title{Generate an average \code{MSnSet}}
\usage{
averageMSnSet(x, avg = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), disp = npcv)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{list} of valid \code{MSnSet} instances to be averaged.}

\item{avg}{The averaging function. Default is hte median after
removing missing valiues, as computed by \code{function(x)
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)}.}

\item{disp}{The disperion function. Default is an non-parametric
coefficient of variation that replaces the standard deviation by
the median absolute deviation as computed by
\code{mad(x)/abs(mean(x))}. See \code{\link{npcv}} for
details. Note that the \code{mad} of a single value is 0 (as
opposed to \code{NA} for the standard deviation, see example
below).}
}
\value{
A new average \code{MSnSet}.
}
\description{
Given a list of \code{MSnSet} instances, typically representing
replicated experiments, the function returns an average
\code{MSnSet}.
}
\details{
This function is aimed at facilitating the visualisation of
replicated experiments and should not be used as a replacement for
a statistical analysis.

The samples of the instances to be averaged must be identical but
can be in a different order (they will be reordered by
default). The features names of the result will correspond to the
union of the feature names of the input \code{MSnSet}
instances. Each average value will be computed by the \code{avg}
function and the dispersion of the replicated measurements will be
estimated by the \code{disp} function. These dispersions will be
stored as a \code{data.frame} in the feature metadata that can be
accessed with \code{fData(.)$disp}. Similarly, the number of
missing values that were present when average (and dispersion)
were computed are available in \code{fData(.)$disp}.

Currently, the feature metadata of the returned object corresponds
the the feature metadata of the first object in the list
(augmented with the missing value and dispersion values); the
metadata of the features that were missing in this first input are
missing (i.e. populated with \code{NA}s). This may change in the
future.
