\title{ Combines features in an \code{MSnSet} object }


\description{

  This function combines the features in an
  \code{"\linkS4class{MSnSet}"} instance applying a summarisation
  function (see \code{fun} argument) to sets of features as defined by a
  factor (see \code{groupBy} argument).  Note that the feature names are
  automatically updated based on the \code{groupBy} parameter.

  The coefficient of variations are automatically computed and collated
  to the featureData slot. See \code{cv} and \code{cv.norm} arguments
  for details.

  If NA values are present, a message will be remind the user. Details
  on how missing value impact on the data aggregation are provided
  below.

}

\usage{

combineFeatures(object, groupBy, fun = c("mean", "median",
"weighted.mean", "sum", "medpolish", "robust", "iPQF", "NTR"), fcol,
redundancy.handler = c("unique", "multiple"), cv = TRUE, cv.norm =
"sum", verbose = isMSnbaseVerbose(), ...)

}

\arguments{

  \item{object}{ An instance of class \code{"\linkS4class{MSnSet}"}
    whose features will be summerised. }

  \item{groupBy}{ A \code{factor}, \code{character}, \code{numeric} or a
    \code{list} of the above defining how to summerise the features. The
    list must be of length \code{nrow(object)}. Each element of the list
    is a vector describing the feature mapping. If the list can be
    named, its names must match \code{fetureNames(object)}. See
    \code{redundancy.handler} for details about the latter. }

  \item{fun}{ The summerising function. Currently, mean, median,
    weighted mean, sum, median polish, robust summarisation (using
    \code{MASS::rlm}), iPQF (see \code{\link{iPQF}} for details) and NTR
    (see \code{\link[MSnbase]{NTR}} for details) are implemented, but
    user-defined functions can also be supplied. Note that the robust
    menthods assumes that the data are already log-transformed.
  }

  \item{fcol}{Feature meta-data label (fData column name) defining how
    to summerise the features. It must be present in
    \code{fvarLabels(object)} and, if present, will be used to defined
    \code{groupBy} as \code{fData(object)[, fcol]}. Note that
    \code{fcol} is ignored if \code{groupBy} is present. }

  \item{redundancy.handler}{ If \code{groupBy} is a \code{list}, one of
    \code{"unique"} (default) or \code{"multiple"} (ignored otherwise)
    defining how to handle peptides that can be associated to multiple
    higher-level features (proteins) upon combination. Using
    \code{"unique"} will only consider uniquely matching features
    (features matching multiple proteins will be discarded).
    \code{"multiple"} will allow matching to multiple proteins and each
    feature will be repeatedly tallied for each possible matching
    protein. }

  \item{cv}{ A \code{logical} defining if feature coefficients of
    variation should be computed and stored as feature
    meta-data. Default is \code{TRUE}. }

  \item{cv.norm}{ A \code{character} defining how to normalise the
    feature intensitites prior to CV calculation. Default is
    \code{sum}. Use \code{none} to keep intensities as is. See
    \code{\link{featureCV}} for more details. }

  \item{verbose}{ A \code{logical} indicating whether verbose output is
    to be printed out. }

  \item{\dots}{ Additional arguments for the \code{fun} function. }
}


\value{

  A new \code{"\linkS4class{MSnSet}"} instance is returned with
  \code{ncol} (i.e. number of samples) is unchanged, but \code{nrow}
  (i.e. the number od features) is now equals to the number of levels in
  \code{groupBy}. The feature metadata (\code{featureData} slot) is
  updated accordingly and only the first occurrence of a feature in the
  original feature meta-data is kept.

}

\details{

  NB: All the functions available as \code{fun} take a \code{na.rm}
  argument. This argument is \code{FALSE} by default. This will have as
  effect that \code{NA} get propagated at the higher level. It is
  generally advised to set \code{na.rm = TRUE}. for \code{robust},
  missing values should be removed beforehand with
  \code{\link{filterNA}}.


  Missing values have different effect based on the aggregation method
  employed, as detailed below. See also examples below.

  \enumerate{

    \item When using either \code{"sum"}, \code{"mean"},
    \code{"weighted.mean"} or \code{"median"}, any missing value will be
    propagated at the higher level. If \code{na.rm = TRUE} is used, then
    the missing value will be ignored.

    \item Missing values will result in an error when using
    \code{"medpolish"}, unless \code{na.rm = TRUE} is used.

    \item When using robust summarisation (\code{"robust"}), individual
    missing values are excluded prior to fitting the linear model by
    robust regression. To remove all values in the feature containing
    the missing values, use \code{filterNA}.

    \item The \code{"iPQF"} method will fail with an error if missing
    value are present, which will have to be handled explicitly. See
    below.

  }

  More generally, missing values often need dedicated handling such as
  filtering (see \code{\link{filterNA}}) or imputation (see
  \code{\link{impute}}).
